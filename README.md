# Video Streaming Analytics with Apache Spark


## Introduction

Apache Spark Streaming is a leading platform that provides scalable and fast data stream processing and is widely used to solve such problems as real-time predictions, pattern recognition, streaming analytics, and many more.  
In this project, I will use Apache Spark to build an Analytics System that helps overcome streaming problems.
Video Streaming Platforms can differ one from another in terms of implementation, but most of them have the following components in common: Video Processing, Media Packaging, Media Storage and Video Distribution.
