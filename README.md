# Video Streaming Analytics with Apache Spark


## Introduction

Apache Spark Streaming is a leading platform that provides scalable and fast data stream processing and is widely used to solve such problems as real-time predictions, pattern recognition, streaming analytics, and many more.  
In this project, I will use Apache Spark to build an Analytics System for Video Streaming platforms. Video Streaming Analytics helps overcome streaming problems, understand the audience better and optimize the viewerâ€™s satisfaction by ensuring higher video streaming quality.  
I will build the code as generic as possible and contribute it to the community as the Apache Spark package ([label](https://spark-packages.org/)). I am aware that Video Streaming Platforms can differ from one to another. However, I will assume that most of them have the following components in common: Video Processing, Media Packaging, Media Storage, and Video Distribution.
