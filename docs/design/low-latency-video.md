1. Dasher versus Frane by Frane
    - Slicer but making all bitrates, needs a lot of resources on client-side
    - Demuxer (?)
    - Gstreamer, DirectShow versus Uplynk Graph
    - Frame by Frame


2. Problems
    = Slicer adds latency
    - Encoders not in RT (Nvidia generic, Xlink AWS VT1)
    - Jitter warm uptime
    -  
        
3. WebRTC
